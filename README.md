<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p> In this project I developed a RESTful web application using the Python framework that provides a list of rooms and storages in these rooms. I integrated third party user registration and authentication. Authenticated users have the ability to add and edit a room, as well as post, edit and delete the storages in their rooms. </p>

<p> I also implemented JSON and XML endpoints. </p>

<p> For the responsiveness I used Bootstrap Framework. </p>
